# RACIAL BIAS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

## Context and description : 

  This paper was written, fully in English, for a course of Philosophical Issues about Computer Science that I followed during my Erasmus at Politecnico di Milano.
  The subject was rather free, which allowed me to align my interest in some sociologic issues with my field of studies.
  This paper, with the help of real life cases of racial biases in some algorithms, allows to define the bias in AI, as well as possible solutions given with a critical aspect.
  
  Good reading !
